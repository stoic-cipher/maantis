## Overview

Quick summary of what we're building/solving and why it matters.

**Tech Stack:**
- Framework/Language
- Database
- Infrastructure

**Performance Metrics:**
- Page load: X ms
- API response: X ms
- Throughput: X req/s

## The Challenge

What problem were we solving? What were the constraints?

## Architecture

High-level system design.

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │─────▶│     API     │─────▶│  Database   │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```

## Implementation

### Step 1: [Component Name]

```typescript
// Code example
interface Config {
  // ...
}
```

**Why this approach:**
- Reason 1
- Reason 2

### Step 2: [Next Component]

```typescript
// More code
```

## Performance Optimization

What we measured and how we improved it:

**Before:**
- Metric 1: X ms
- Metric 2: X MB

**After:**
- Metric 1: Y ms (Z% improvement)
- Metric 2: Y MB (Z% reduction)

**Techniques Used:**
1. Caching strategy
2. Database indexing
3. Code splitting
4. etc.

## Lessons Learned

- Key learning 1
- Key learning 2
- Gotchas to avoid

## Production Results

Real-world metrics after deployment:
- Uptime: 99.X%
- Response time: X ms p95
- Error rate: X%
