# Your WordPress Site Is Wasting Half Your PPC Budget

**The Problem:**

You're spending six figures monthly on PPC.

Your WordPress site loads in 5 seconds and converts at 2%.

You think that's normal.

It's not. You're just measuring against other slow sites.

**The same PPC budget on proper infrastructure delivers 2-3x the patient inquiries.**

Not more traffic. Better conversion of the traffic you're already paying for.

## The Load Time Reality

Google's data:

| Load Time | Bounce Rate Increase |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 second  | Baseline |
| 3 seconds | +32% |
| 5 seconds | +38% |
| 6 seconds | +106% |

**Your 5-second site loses 38% of paid traffic before they see your content.**

You're paying for 12,000 clicks.
Only ~7,400 people actually experience your site.
The other 4,600 bounced before the page loaded.

## The Conversion Rate Gap

Industry benchmarks by load time:

- **<1 second:** 4-6% conversion
- **2-3 seconds:** 3-4% conversion  
- **5+ seconds:** 1-2% conversion

Your 2% conversion isn't a marketing problem. It's an infrastructure problem.

## The Real Comparison

Same $120K/month PPC budget:

### WordPress Site
- Load time: 5 seconds
- Conversion rate: 2%
- Monthly inquiries: 240
- **Getting 50% of potential**

### Custom Astro Site
- Load time: <1 second
- Conversion rate: 4-6%
- Monthly inquiries: 480-720
- **Getting 100%+ of potential**

Same money. Same ads. Same keywords.

The only difference is whether your infrastructure can handle the traffic you're paying for.

## What Proper Certification Delivers

Beyond raw speed:

**Google PageSpeed Score:**
- WordPress average: 30-50/100
- Custom Astro optimized: 95-100/100

**Core Web Vitals:**
- Largest Contentful Paint: <1.2s vs 4-6s
- First Input Delay: <100ms vs 300-500ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1 vs 0.3-0.5

These metrics directly impact:
1. Google Ads Quality Score (lowers your CPC over time)
2. Organic search rankings (reduces PPC dependency)
3. User trust and conversion rates

**A properly certified site doesn't just convert better. It costs less to advertise on over time.**

## The Compound Effect

**Year 1:**
- Same PPC budget performs 2x better
- Google recognizes faster site, improves Quality Score
- CPC starts declining

**Year 2:**
- Lower CPC = more clicks for same budget
- Continued optimization pushes conversion higher
- Same spend generates more inquiries

**Year 3:**
- Organic traffic from technical SEO reduces PPC dependency
- Can maintain same inquiry volume at lower spend
- Or scale inquiries at same spend

WordPress sites don't compound. They decay.

Custom infrastructure improves. Every optimization builds on the last.

## The Real Question

It's not "How much does a custom site cost?"

It's "How much PPC budget are we wasting on infrastructure that can't convert?"

Every month you run on WordPress is another month you're:
- Paying for clicks that bounce
- Getting half the inquiries you should
- Losing patients to faster competitors

## The Bottom Line

Your PPC budget isn't the problem.

Your infrastructure's inability to convert that traffic is.

A custom Astro site with proper certification doesn't add cost to your operation.

It stops wasting the six figures you're already spending monthly.

**Same traffic. Double the conversions. More people helped.**

That's not a marketing improvement. That's an infrastructure fix.
